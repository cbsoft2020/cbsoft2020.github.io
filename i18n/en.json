The \"City of the Sun\" (\"Cidade do Sol\", in Portuguese), as it is known both nationally and internationally, has a pleasant climate with average temperatures around 28ºC and a bright sunshine throughout the year. Natal is about six degrees south Equator, thus making the sun to shine for 300 days per year, more than in any Brazilian capital.",
    "descricao_2": "Founded in a Christmas Day, December 25, 1599 (hence the name, according to many writers), Natal is bathed by the Atlantic Ocean, combining a tropical climate, beautiful beaches of warm water, lush nature, and almost 900,000 welcoming inhabitants - just over 1.5 million in the Metropolitan Region, the fifth largest urban agglomeration in the Northeast Region. The city historically had a great importance during World War II, serving as a strategic point to Allies operations (in particular to USA) in the conflict, and it hosted the first rocket base in South America, at the Barreira do Inferno Launch Center in the neighboring municipality of Parnamirim.",
    "descricao_3": "The city receives millions of Brazilian and foreign visitors each year, attracted by the natural beauty of the cost, the local hospitality, and the largest off-season Carnival in Brazil, <i>Carnatal</i>. Natal has one of the most modern and well-located hotel chains in Brazil, besides excellent restaurants, pubs, bars, shopping malls, and many other entertainement places. This is a reflection of the fact that the local economy is mainly based on the service sector, including national and international leisure tourism and, more recently, the business tourism, as the city has attracted an increasing number of professional events. Moreover, in 2014, Natal was one of the twelve cities that hosted the FIFA World Cup, whose project of the Arena das Dunas Stadium stood out among the host cities.",
    "descricao_4": "Natal is not just about beaches, lush nature, and good gastronomy. The city was recently affiliated to the <i>IEEE Smart Cities Initative</i> as a result of the expressive advances and strong engagement between academia and local government. This gave risen to the <i>Natal Human and Smart City Program</i>, formalized by a technical cooperation agreement between the Natal City Hall and the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN). This program represents a large political and societal project in direct cooperation between academia and the population aiming at seeking for solutions to the problems faced by the city in its daily growth, as well as improving the quality of life and well-being of the population through innovative Information and Communication Technology paradigms. In 2017, the <i>Digital Metropolis Technological Park</i> was established. This is a technological park geographically located around the UFRN's central campus with focus on Information Technology, a project involving academia and both public and private sectors as a conductive environment to the diffusion of science, technology, and innovation, besides contributing to the economic and societal development of the city."

Serving Natal and its Metropolitan Region, the airport was opened in 2014 and it is regarded as one of the best airports in Brazil according to recent surveys. Although Natal is not a major hub in Brazil, there are direct flights connecting it to other larger Brazilian cities, such as Fortaleza (1:00h), Recife (0:50h), Salvador (1:25h), Brasilia (2:45h), Rio de Janeiro (3:00h), and São Paulo (3:20h). There are also some international direct flights connecting Natal to Lisbon, Portugal, and to Buenos Aires, Argentina, but due to national connections to other cities in Brazil, it is not difficult to reach Natal from North America or Europe. All major Brazilian airlines (Azul, Gol, LATAM) currently operate at the airport, in addition to TAP Portugal, Portuguese airline whose direct flights connect Natal to Europe in 6:40h on average",
