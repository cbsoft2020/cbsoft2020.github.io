		"title": "Systematic Software Testing for Deep Learning Applications",
		"abstract": "We are now seeing a paradigm shift in software development, where decision making is increasingly shifting from hand-coded program logic to Deep Learning (DL) - popular applications of Speech Processing, Image Recognition, Robotics, Go game, etc. are using DL as their core components. Deep Neural Network (DNN), a widely used architecture of DL, is the key behind such progress. With such spectacular progress, they are also increasingly being used in safety-critical systems such as autonomous cars, medical diagnosis, malware detection, and aircraft collision avoidance systems. Such wide adoption of DL techniques comes with concerns about the reliability of these systems, as several erroneous behaviors have already been reported. Thus, it has become crucial to rigorously test these DL applications with realistic corner cases to ensure high reliability. However, due to the fundamental architectural differences between DNN and traditional software, existing software testing techniques do not apply to them in any obvious way. In fact, companies such as Google, Tesla, etc. are increasingly facing all the traditional software testing challenges to ensure reliable and safe DL applications. This talk will address how to systematically test Deep Learning applications.",

		"title": "The CTO Handbook for Large Architectural Decisions",
		"abstract": "Technological decisions are in practice bound by several organizational and business constraints, often not studied in depth as much as the intrinsic aspects of the technologies being considered. This talk will dive on the implicit framework used to introduce a new programming language in Loggi, a scale-up stage company, taking into account aspects as hiring, library availability, codebase transitioning and competition.",
		"bio": "Davi de Castro Reis, a computer scientist, started his career working as a developer and white hat hacker in the world of ISPs. During his MSc, he worked as database and information retrieval scientist, created the RTDM algorithm, co-authored the CMPH open source library, and joined Akwan, the startup that became Google Brazil. He worked during ten years at Google, leading projects in Search, Mobile and Social Ads. He brought Orkut from zero revenue to profitability and led the Google Pigeon project, improving local search for billions of people. He also co-founded, almost scaled and acquisold WorldSense. He is currently helping to rebuild Brazil's logistics as the CTO for Loggi."
